In this workshop we learned the correct use of classes and how to scope
works inside of it. Mainly we understood how are classes created and how
data and functions are store inside of them by having methods and 
members that can have different permission levels mainly being the 
methods that can be access by outsiders to the class and members that can
only be modified by the class itself. Additionally we saw the use of the
clauses this and from used to refer to level of scope when referring 
inside of a class giving practicality and readability when working with
multile variables and different classes. In summary this workshop gave 
us a closer understanding to what Object-Oriented Programming is showing
the basic structure of the smallest object of this structure a class or 
an object and how to handle the data inside of it by referencing its 
methods and members according to the set privacy.
