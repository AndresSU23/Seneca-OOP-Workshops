***********************************************************************/

In this workshop, we're exploring the inner workings of iostream, with 
a particular focus on cin and cout for effectively managing formatted 
outputs and processing extensive string inputs. Instead of relying on 
traditional C expressions, we're turning our attention to some powerful 
new functions, including setw, setfill, right, and left. These functions
 offer us precise control over the characters within cout, allowing us 
to finely adjust text alignment and spacing.

With these tools in our toolkit, we can produce elegant, custom-formatted
 outputs tailored to our needs. Additionally, we're exploring the cin
 function getline, which serves a similar purpose as the %[^\n] expression
 in C. This function enables us to capture all characters in the input 
until it encounters a newline character, making it exceptionally valuable 
for managing large string inputs.

Overall, this workshop equips us with a comprehensive understanding of 
iostream, empowering us to craft sophisticated code while efficiently 
handling input and output operations in C++.
