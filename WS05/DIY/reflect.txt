I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
 that my professor provided to complete my workshops and
 assignments.

In our recent workshop on C++ operators, we dived into the 
world of operator usage and manipulation. We gained a solid 
grasp of the correct application of these operators and 
explored their versatile functions. An important takeaway was
 the ability to employ operators as efficient getters and 
setters, thus eliminating the need for additional functions
 dedicated to these tasks. This newfound knowledge streamlines
 our coding processes and enables us to exercise more precise
 control over private data within objects and classes. This 
workshop taught us to write more efficient and maintainable 
code.
