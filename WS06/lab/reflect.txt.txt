	During this workshop we saw the Object-Oriented approach to the 
input and output by treating them as object changing the reference to 
them depending on the desired reading and writing output. This workshop 
showed the correct way to design read and print functions regardless of 
the channel of information. The only change made to these traditional 
functions is that we are passing the reference to the channel in 
question as an attribute and returning guaranteeing the use the given 
channel instead of the default standard cin and cout. Additionally, this 
laboratory allowed us to reinforce the concepts of polymorphism and 
operators. By creating numerous functions for the easy loading and 
setting of data. This allowed us to have a more coherent workspace were 
checks and assignments were only done in specific functions instead of 
having them disperse around the program reducing the number of bugs and 
deallocated memory. In Summary, we reinforced the appropriate use of 
polymorphism and learn the application of OOP towards more efficient 
data interactions functions that allowed for a more efficent style of 
coding that reduces the code complexity.
