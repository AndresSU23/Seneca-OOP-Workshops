In this workshop we practiced inheritance by using the attributes, 
constructors, and methods of a base class, while managing an 
organize environment with no memory leaks. We learned how to use 
inherited methods since these are not automatically added to the 
derived class, they must be manually called by instantiating the base 
class first followed by the desired method or attribute. Additionally, 
we saw the behavior of constructors and destructors, which should call 
and instantiate by the derived class as the logic needs them, if they 
are not specifically called, they will initialize with the default 
values. In summary, this workshop taught us the correct way to use the 
data and logic of an inherited class when this one has its own behavior
and it's not abstract. Simultaneously, managing the creation and 
destruction of base classes by designing a cohesive logic checking for 
memory leaks, and always referring to the base classes behavior when 
allocating added information.
