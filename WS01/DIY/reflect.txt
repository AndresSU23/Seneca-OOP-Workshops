Participation in the workshop was extremely beneficial as it required me to gain a comprehensive understanding of module 
programming in C++. This involved mastering the skill of using namespaces and header files effectively. Within these 
header files, build sets were implemented to carefully distinguish headers and ensure their orderly execution.

Additionally, the workshop provided valuable insights into how to use the power of namespaces to improve 
organizational clarity within modules. Furthermore, I immersed myself in the fascinating world of function polymorphism, 
which allowed me to create well-structured code that features multiple implementations and effortless readability. This 
hands-on experience not only polished my C++ skills, but also trained me to create code that is both organized and 
easily understandable.
