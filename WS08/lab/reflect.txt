In this workshop, we explored the concepts and applications of 
inheritance and derived classes in C++. Our primary goal was to 
understand how to effectively use these concepts to create elements that
 share traits with a parent class by extending base classes. A key aspect
 involved gaining a solid grasp of the process for selecting base class 
aspects during implementation and ensuring the correct method for calling
 them.

The practical side of our exploration included hands-on experimentation
 with various objects inheriting from the same base classes. During this
 phase, we adjusted base methods and made necessary modifications to 
data members and constructors. This direct experience not only 
reinforced our understanding of inheriting from base classes but also 
refined our ability to adapt methods for different implementations.

As a result of this immersive workshop, we've developed the practical 
skills to inherit from base classes and modify methods to suit diverse 
needs. This proficiency allows us to effortlessly create multiple 
objects, each showcasing behaviors precisely tailored to meet 
specific programming requirements.
