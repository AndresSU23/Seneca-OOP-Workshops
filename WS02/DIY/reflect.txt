In this workshop we learn about the correct use of dynamic memory and 
how to fix the memory leaks. We explore the benefits of having the 
dynamic memory against the static one, this allows us to have a more 
efficient use of memory we could release and allocate memory in runtime 
allowing less memory wastage. Because of this we had to be careful to 
lead any memory without deallocation, this inactivates a more organize 
style of coding where we kept record of our variables since a careless 
use of this could lead memory leaks and less readability. Additionally, 
in this workshop the basic concept of class constructor was used to 
achieve an easier time deallocating the memory, since all class strings 
were allocated at the initialization of the class regardless of their 
use. In summary, we learned how to practically use dynamic memory and 
understand memory leaks based on their usage.
