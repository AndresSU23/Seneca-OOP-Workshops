During this workshop we implemented a new concept essential for 
Object-Oriented Programming called Inheritance. This tool allows us to 
reuse other classes as template creation for new ones. Giving us the 
opportunity to use the attributes and behavior of the father class. 
Additionally, we learned new ways to set privacy related to inheritance 
where the new class can only get certain parts of the original class 
allowing for a more organize application with less risk of bugs, by 
setting the attributes and methods as protected we can have the same 
restrictions as private but share it with the one who inherit it. 
Finally, we saw the behavior of scopes in these scenarios where the 
new class will shadow the inherited class having priority when 
presented with overloaded methods. In summary, this workshop 
introduces us to the implementation of inheritance in c++ how create 
and call methods, regarding the privacy and scope of the inherited 
one.
